# Project-Ai-CV
 The Machine Learning Platform (Tensorflow with Keras) is used to predict the hand gesture by the user inorder to control the media player. I have used VideoLAN media player's HotKeys.

The image.py file - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t0DQwpNDlP3wtMwrrvGCGYRwvukJF79i/view - this is the python file to train your own ML model.

Incase if you don't have the appropriate hardware or just want to try out the AI , Use this file in the repo-Classification.ipynb and this is the link for trained ML model which I used in the said file - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zc7mcbxp25bH6m17-UY5n_1Sf16zRsNt/view


Yet more info has to come !!! Stay tuned !
